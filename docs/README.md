# SSO Shell
## What am I?
SSO Shell is a three-part software for managing access control and SSH Certificates for multiple hosts across your environment.

## Why am I?
Simply because I haven't found a currently maintained, open-source SSO solution for managing access to multiple hosts. There is a host of software available, like smallstep-ca, teleport and others but they all seem to have their weaknesses, or lack of features in the open-source/self-hosted version.
